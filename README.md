Using data from the Virginia Department of Education, we wanted to take a closer look at graduation trends across the state. The scope of this is data from 2000-2019, dependant on the records provided by the state. Analysis was done at a school, state, and national level. 

Factors such as demographics including race, gender, and income were looked at to determine if they influence graduation rates at all. 
Teacher's salaries were also considered as a factor, and Virginia was compared on a national level.

We also wanted to look at post-graduation plans and if the economy and changing mind-sets have impacted these trends.

Several limitations were encountered. If we had more time, we could have explored the correlation between attendance rate and graduation rate as well as correlation between state/federal funding and graduation rate.

Even with these limitations, we were able to draw several conclusions including:  
1) Lower income communities have lower graduation rates. 
2) Larger communities have higher graduation. 
3) Caucasians have higher graduation rates than other races. 
4) No major change in post-secondary plans. Students are continuing to pursue higher education.
